Plantz is a genetic evolution of digital plantlife. 

Each plant is defined by a genome sequence (for example ["4B239436","3EDE1989","6AEB806C","A89EEF98"]), which starts randomized. This sequence dictates the growth and structure of the plant cells. 

Plants are rewarded on how many cells grown (red and green cells), and rewarded even more with branches (green cells). Plants absorb moisture from the ground (dark brown), and can only grow with enough moisture collected by its roots. Over time you will create a plant with a unique Genome Sequence. You can save and share this plant sequence with a friend. 

Plants with the highest score show up on a list to the right, which you can copy and paste.

If you find a cool sequence, drop it in the comments so others can check it out!
